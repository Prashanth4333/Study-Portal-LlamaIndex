Designs, trains/tunes, evaluates, and productionizes generative models and the systems around them. That includes:

prompt engineering & prompt/system design,

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) & knowledge ingestion,

fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA/PEFT/QLoRA),

model infra (serving, scaling, latency/cost tradeoffs),

evaluation, safety, and monitoring (hallucinations, bias, misuse),

tooling and MLOps for repeatability and governance.

High-level learning flow (compact)
Foundations → Model Fundamentals → Practical Gen-AI (APIs & LLMs) → RAG + Retrieval → Fine-tuning & PEFT → Evaluation & Safety → Production + MLOps → Scale & Research.

BEGINNER (0 → 2 months) — learn the foundations, get hands-on fast
Goal: Understand basic ML/NLP concepts, call LLM APIs, build simple RAG chatbot, learn tooling.

Core knowledge & skills
Programming: solid Python (virtualenv/venv, packages, typing basics).

ML basics: supervised learning, loss, gradients — intuition only.

NLP basics: tokens, tokenization, embedding idea, seq → label concept.

Prompting & API usage: how to call an LLM (system + user prompts), temperature, max_tokens, top_p, stop sequences, simple few-shot prompting.

Data handling: text cleaning, chunking/segmentation, simple metadata.

Embeddings & retrieval: concept of embedding vectors and nearest-neighbor retrieval.

Vector stores (conceptual): what a vector DB does (store/query by embedding) — e.g., local FAISS / in-memory vs hosted solutions.

Tools & libs to install & try
Python, pip, requests/httpx, Jupyter/Colab.

Hugging Face transformers & diffusers (for experimentation).

Sentence-transformers (for embeddings) and FAISS or a simple in-memory vector store.

Try a hosted LLM API (OpenAI/Anthropic/Cohere/Hugging Face Inference) for quick prototyping.

First practical project (weekend)
Tiny RAG chat assistant

Ingest a handful of docs (PDF/text).

Chunk docs into ~1–2k token pieces, generate embeddings, index in FAISS.

For a query: embed query → top-k search → stitch top docs into a prompt template → call LLM and return answer.

Minimal pseudo-code sketch (high-level):

python
Copy
Edit
# 1) embed docs (with sentence-transformers or API embeddings)
# 2) index into FAISS
# 3) on query:
q_emb = embed(query)
ids, scores = faiss_index.search(q_emb, k=5)
context = "\n\n".join(docs[i] for i in ids)
prompt = f"Use the following docs to answer:\n\n{context}\n\nQ: {query}"
answer = llm_api.call(prompt)
Beginner deliverables
Working RAG chatbot on localhost or Colab.

Short write-up: dataset description, chunking strategy, prompt templates used, failure cases observed.

INTERMEDIATE (2 → 8 months) — deep practical skillset & reproducible workflows
Goal: fine-tune & customize models, build robust retrieval pipelines, evaluation metrics, simple production deployment.

Core areas to learn & practice
Transformers internals (practical):

tokenizers, attention basics, encoder vs decoder vs seq2seq.

how context length affects design and cost (chunking strategies, sliding windows).

Embeddings and Vector DBs:

vector DB options & tradeoffs (FAISS/Annoy/chroma/Pinecone/Weaviate/Milvus): latency, persistence, scaling, metadata filtering (MMS/filters).

embedding quality matters — try sentence-transformers vs API embeddings.

RAG patterns & pipelines:

Retriever + Reader architecture, dense retrievers vs hybrid (sparse + dense).

Retrieval augmentation: rerankers, citation/attribution strategies, provenance tracking, retrieval prompts.

Fine-tuning & PEFT:

Full fine-tuning vs parameter-efficient approaches (LoRA/PEFT), QLoRA for memory-efficient finetune on large models.

Data preparation: instruction tuning, formatting dialogs, deduplication, quality labeling, dataset balancing.

Evaluation & human-in-the-loop:

Automated signals: perplexity, ROUGE/BLEU for some tasks (limited), answer overlap metrics; embedding-based similarity and faithfulness metrics.

Human eval: rubric design, A/B testing, red-team tests to elicit harmful outputs.

Calibration & confidence: when to abstain or escalate to human.

Model safety & filtering:

Input sanitization, prompt injection awareness, output filters, content moderation layers, rate limits and access controls.

Serving & lightweight productionization:

Create an inference API (FastAPI/uvicorn), simple batching/caching, rate limiting.

Consider a simple managed solution for inference or containerized model with local GPU if using open models.

# embed query -> search vector DB -> build prompt -> call LLM
q_emb = embed(query)                       # use sentence-transformers or API embeddings
ids = vector_db.query(q_emb, top_k=5)      # returns doc ids + metadata
ctx = "\n\n".join([docs[i] for i in ids])
prompt = f"Context:\n{ctx}\n\nAnswer concisely: {query}"

3) PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning sketch (conceptual)
python
Copy
Edit

model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
# prepare dataset, Trainer, and train (small lr, gradient accumulation)
(Use framework docs / accelerate for large models and multi-GPU.)

Evaluation, metrics & human review (practice)
Retrieval metrics: recall@k, MRR for retrieval quality.

Answer quality metrics: human score (precision-like scales), automated heuristics (overlap, factuality signals), consistency checks (ask rephrasing).

Safety metrics: incidents per thousand queries, rate of outputs flagged by filters, red-team success rate.

Business metrics: task completion rate, user satisfaction, fallbacks to human operator.

Responsible AI & safety checklist (production)
Dataset documentation (sources, licenses, sampling bias).

Model card describing intended use, limitations, and evaluation results.

Access controls and rate limits by user tier.

Content moderation & escalation path for harmful outputs.

Privacy & PII handling rules; minimize logging of raw user content; redact or encrypt PII in logs; follow local laws.

Recommended projects (by level) — concrete deliverables
Beginner: RAG FAQ bot for a website (FAISS + simple prompt).

Intermediate: Domain assistant (legal/medical/product docs) with fine-tuned LLM, provenance, and CI that runs retrieval/answer tests.

Advanced: Multi-tenant RAG platform (tenant isolation, streaming indexing, SLOs, observability, cost controls) + RLHF or alignment experiments on internal data.

Interview prep checklist for Gen-AI engineer roles
Explain transformer attention and tokenizer issues (OOM & context length tradeoffs).

Describe RAG architecture and failure modes (retrieval misses, hallucinations).

Walk through a fine-tuning or PEFT pipeline and tradeoffs (compute, data volume, forgetting).

Show how to profile and reduce inference latency or cost (quantization, batching, caching, model choice).

Discuss safety: prompt injection, privacy, and mitigation strategies.

Whiteboard: design a scalable chatbot architecture with multi-model fallback and monitoring.

Career paths & roles you’ll grow into
GenAI Engineer / ML Engineer (build models + productionize).

MLOps / Platform Engineer (infrastructure for training/serving).

Research Engineer (prototype new model ideas and publish).

Safety/Alignment Engineer (red-team, alignment pipelines, policy).

Lead / Architect (design multi-model systems, governance).

Common pitfalls & how to avoid them
Relying on token counts as proxy for cost — measure end-to-end costs (embedding + retrieval + LLM).

Ignoring retrieval provenance — always surface the source of retrieved content.

Poor dataset hygiene — bad data creates persistent model biases.

No automated eval — without continuous checks you’ll regress silently.

Not monitoring user queries — rare/abusive inputs can break models in production.

Beginner (0 → ~3 months) — Foundation & velocity
Goal: learn Python syntax, core libraries, basic tooling, and ship small projects.

Core skills
Python syntax & REPL: variables, types, control flow, functions, modules.

Built-in data structures: list, tuple, set, dict.

I/O & file handling: open, context managers (with).

Basic OOP: classes, __init__, methods, simple inheritance.

Exceptions: try/except/finally.

Standard library essentials: os, sys, pathlib, json, datetime, collections, itertools.

Virtual environments: python -m venv venv and activating it.

pip + requirements.txt (installing packages).

Readability & style: PEP8 basics — use black and flake8.

Recommended timeline
Weeks 1–2: syntax, types, and small scripts (calculator, file parser).

Weeks 3–4: functions, modules, OOP basics — write small classes.

Weeks 5–8: standard library, virtualenv, pip, basic package use (requests).

Beginner checklist (what “done” looks like)
Use virtualenv for projects.

Repo with README, license, simple tests.

Able to debug with print & basic pdb.

Understand basic Git and push a PR.

Intermediate (3 → 12 months) — Real apps, good practices, and tooling
Goal: build web apps / APIs, write clean tests, use databases, and operate local dev workflows.

Core skills
Web frameworks: Flask (micro) or FastAPI (async-first) or Django (full-stack).

HTTP & web fundamentals: status codes, headers, query params, REST principles.

Databases: SQL basics, use PostgreSQL (psycopg / SQLAlchemy), simple migrations (Alembic).

ORMs: SQLAlchemy (core/ORM) or Django ORM.

Asynchronous Python: async/await basics, asyncio event loop; when to use async.

Packaging & dependency management: pyproject.toml, poetry (or pip + requirements).

Testing: pytest with fixtures, mocking, integration tests.

Logging & config: structured logging (logging), environment config patterns (12-factor).

Milestones: API endpoints → DB schema → tests → Dockerfile → deploy to Heroku/Vercel-compatible backend.

Project D: Task manager with Web UI

Full-stack: React or plain HTML + server templates (Django), API for tasks, authentication.

Milestones: server API → client UI → secure auth (JWT/session) → file uploads.

Dev & infra skills
Docker commands: docker build -t app ., docker run -p 8000:8000 app.

Local Postgres with Docker: docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -p 5432:5432 postgres.

CI pipeline: automatically run tests, lint, build docker image on PR.

Integration tests for DB/API (use test DB or fixtures).

Write a small set of E2E tests with Playwright or simple curl checks.

Intermediate checklist
Projects have tests with CI passing.

App can be containerized and deployed.

Typing introduced in core modules.

Basic async knowledge and when not to use it.

Advanced (12 months → years) — Production, scale, architecture & performance
Goal: design secure, scalable systems; optimize performance; mentor others and own design decisions.

Core skills & deep topics
Advanced Python internals: memory model, reference counting, garbage collection (gc), how the GIL works and implications.

Performance: profiling (cProfile, py-spy), optimizing hot paths, using asyncio effectively, batching I/O, connection pooling.

Concurrency & parallelism: threads vs processes vs asyncio vs worker pools; concurrent.futures and multiprocessing; worker systems (Celery, RQ).

C extensions & speedups: Cython, Numba, writing CPython extensions, or using Rust with PyO3 for critical code.

Type system mastery: large-codebase typing strategies, generics, typing patterns, gradual typing tradeoffs.

Advanced packaging & distribution: publish packages to PyPI, build wheels, use auditwheel/manylinux.

Observability & SRE practices: distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics (Prometheus), log aggregation, structured logs, dashboards & alerts.

Security at scale: threat modeling, OWASP mitigation, secrets management, dependency scanning in CI.

Systems design with Python: microservices, event-driven architectures, idempotency, retries/backoff, data contracts.

Cloud & infra: Kubernetes, autoscaling, managed DBs, serverless patterns (Lambda with containers, API Gateway).

Data engineering & ML ops (optional but valuable): streaming (Kafka), ETL pipelines, data versioning (DVC), model serving (TorchServe/TF Serving), inference scaling.

Architectural leadership: API design at scale, multi-team contracts, migration strategies, rollout patterns (canary, blue/green).

Advanced projects (impactful & portfolio-grade)
Project E: Scalable event-driven service

Ingest stream (Kafka), process messages with idempotency guarantees, store to DB, expose metrics & tracing.

Milestones: local dev stack with Docker Compose → worker autoscaling → tracing setup → deployment to k8s cluster.

Project F: Production ML inference pipeline

Train small model locally, wrap as API with batching and caching, measure latency, deploy to serverless or k8s, add monitoring for model drift.

Project G: Build & publish a Python library

Proper packaging, CI for tests & publishing, documentation, semantic versioning, and maintainability.

Tools & infra
Kubernetes basics: manifests, deployments, services, ingress, secrets, configmaps.

CI/CD best practices: build pipelines, artifact immutability, automated canary rollouts.

Observability stack: Prometheus/Grafana, Loki/ELK for logs, Jaeger for traces.

Security & compliance tooling: SAST, SCA, secret scanning.

Advanced checklist (what excellence looks like)
Able to profile and reduce 99th percentile latency by >X% (measure baseline).

Designs services with clear contracts, retries, backpressure handling.

Production-grade deployment: CI/CD, rollbacks, monitoring, runbooks.

Mentoring & code review culture: enforce testing, help design docs, drive architecture decisions.

Cross-cutting best practices (all levels)
Write tests early. Tests reduce fear of change.

Automate everything: CI runs tests & linters, deploys on merge, and checks security.

Use type hints progressively — they help with refactors.

Model & log metrics: collect basic app metrics (request latency, error rate) from day one.

Keep secrets secret: never commit creds; use env vars or secret managers.

Document assumptions: README, API docs (OpenAPI), design decisions, and migration notes.

Interview & hiring checklist (by level)
Beginner: explain basic constructs, write a function confidently, use lists/dicts, basics of OOP, simple unit test.

Intermediate: design a REST endpoint, SQL joins, ORM tradeoffs, containerize an app, write pytest tests, basic async knowledge.

Advanced: system design for scale, profiling and performance fixes, concurrency traps (GIL), distributed tracing, security threat modeling.

Learning paths & sample 6/12/24-month plan (concise)
6-month focused plan (if you can devote ~10–15 hrs/week)
Months 0–1: Python basics + CLI tools + small scripts.

Months 2–3: Web dev with Flask or FastAPI; DB integration; build & deploy one app.

Months 4–5: Docker + CI + unit/integration tests + some async patterns.

Month 6: Build a production-ready project with monitoring & a README showing architecture.

12-month mastery plan
First 6 months as above.

Months 7–9: Advanced architecture (message queues, caching), optimizations & profiling.

Months 10–12: Kubernetes basics, package a library, publish to PyPI, add SLOs/observability.

24-month to senior-level
Beyond 12 months: design cross-service systems, lead a migration, drive infra work (CI/CD/k8s), mentor team, write design docs, and measure business impact.

Concrete project roadmap example: “TaskFlow” (from beginner → advanced)
Phase 1 (Beginner): CLI Taskflow app

CRUD tasks, save JSON, simple tests.

Phase 2 (Intermediate): Web Taskflow

FastAPI backend + SQLite/Postgres, React frontend, JWT auth, Dockerfile, CI pipeline.

Phase 3 (Advanced): Scalable Taskflow

Migrate DB to Postgres with replicas, add Celery worker for heavy jobs, Kafka for events, Kubernetes deployment, Prometheus metrics, tracing with OpenTelemetry, automated canary deployment.

At each phase, add measurable acceptance criteria (tests passing, LCP < X, error rate < Y).

Common pitfalls & how to avoid them
Premature optimization: measure first (profile), then optimize.

Ignoring tests: leads to brittle code. Automate tests in CI.

N+1 DB queries: watch ORM patterns; use joins/batch queries.

Blocking I/O in async code: don’t call blocking libs in async loop (use threadpool or async equivalents).

Unbounded memory/growth: set limits, watch queues, and monitor heap.

Poor observability: instrument basic metrics and errors from day one.

Books & resources (recommended)
Automate the Boring Stuff — practical beginner projects.

Fluent Python — deeper language mastery.

Effective Python — pragmatic patterns.

Designing Data-Intensive Applications — system design (non-Python specific but essential).

Official Python docs & PEPs for language changes.

Online: Real Python, Full Stack Python, official FastAPI/Flask/Django docs.

Final practical advice (from the viewpoint of an experienced coach)
Ship and measure. Build small things and put them in front of users — feedback accelerates learning.

Work on code you care about (your own projects or OSS) — ownership teaches operational realities.

Write READMEs & postmortems. Explaining failures teaches more than success.

Invest in fundamentals first. Understand algorithms, networking basics, and databases — frameworks change, fundamentals do not.

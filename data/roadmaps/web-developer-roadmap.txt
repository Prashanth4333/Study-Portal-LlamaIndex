Below is a complete, structured roadmap for becoming a strong web developer (full-stack). It’s organized as a learning path plus concrete skills, tools, projects, and career advice — the sort of roadmap a senior engineer would hand a mentee. Read straight through or jump to any section you need.

1) Top-level flow (quick view)
Foundations → Frontend → Backend → Data & Storage → DevOps / Deployment → Testing & Observability → Security → Scale & Architecture → Career / Projects.

2) Foundations (never skip)
Why: Every good web engineer must own the basics — the rest builds on these.

HTML: semantic markup, accessibility basics (alt, headings, forms, landmarks), document metadata.

CSS: box model, cascade & specificity, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design (mobile-first), CSS variables, performance (avoid layout thrash).

JavaScript (ES6+): let/const, arrow functions, promises, async/await, modules, closures, event loop basics.

Version control: git workflows (feature branches, rebasing vs merge, PR reviews).

Browser & HTTP fundamentals: request/response, headers, status codes, CORS, cookies, sessions, TLS basics.

DevTools: network, performance, memory, element inspector, Lighthouse.

3) Frontend (what to master and why)
Goal: build robust, maintainable, accessible, and fast user interfaces.

Core topics:

Frameworks: React (incl. hooks + concurrent concepts), Vue, Svelte — pick one deeply (React is most common).

Routing & rendering models: client-side routing, SSR (server-side rendering), SSG (static generation), incremental/edge rendering.

State management: local state, Context, React Query / TanStack Query (server-state), Redux / Zustand / Recoil (global patterns) — know tradeoffs.

Styling: CSS Modules, Tailwind/utility-first, Styled Components, design tokens, component theming.

Accessibility (A11y): keyboard navigation, ARIA roles only when necessary, semantic HTML, color contrast & screen reader testing.

Testing: unit (Jest/Vitest), component/behavior (React Testing Library), E2E (Playwright / Cypress).

Performance: code-splitting, lazy loading, image optimization (srcset/modern formats), preconnect/preload, critical CSS, Web Vitals (LCP, FID/TBT, CLS).

PWA & Offline: service workers, caching strategies, manifest, app shell pattern.

Advanced UI: animations (transform/opacity), virtualization for long lists, accessibility of custom widgets (modals, dialogs).

Tooling: bundlers (Vite, Webpack), linters & formatters (ESLint + Prettier), Storybook for component libraries.

4) Backend fundamentals (server-side skills)
Goal: design and operate reliable server-side systems, APIs, auth, and data access.

Core topics:

Languages & frameworks (pick 1+): Node.js (Express, Fastify, Nest), Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI), Go, Java (Spring Boot), .NET. Learn idioms, deployment story, and ecosystem.

API design:

RESTful design, status codes, resource modeling.

GraphQL: schema design, pagination, caching, N+1 problems.

gRPC for high-performance RPC.

Authentication & authorization: sessions, JWT, OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (PKCE for SPAs), role-based access control, secure token storage.

Data modeling: relational (Postgres/MySQL) vs NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB) tradeoffs.

Caching: Redis, in-memory caches, cache invalidation strategies.

Background processing: queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), workers, scheduled jobs.

File & media storage: S3-compatible storage, presigned URLs, CDN integration.

Testing & API contracts: unit tests, integration tests, contract testing (Pact), Postman collections.

Observability: structured logging, distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics (Prometheus), error tracking (Sentry).

5) Databases, search & storage patterns
Relational DBs: schema design, normalization vs denormalization, indexes, transactions, migrations (Flyway, Alembic).

NoSQL: document modeling patterns, eventual consistency, partition keys.

Full-text search: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, query design, relevance tuning.

Analytical stores: columnar formats, OLAP patterns (ClickHouse, BigQuery).

Data pipelines: batch vs streaming (Kafka, Kinesis), idempotency, data schema versioning.

6) DevOps & deployment (production readiness)
Goal: deliver code reliably and operate services.

Containers: Docker basics — images, layers, multi-stage builds, healthchecks.

Orchestration: Kubernetes basics — pods, services, ingress, configmaps, secrets, deployments, autoscaling.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / CircleCI — pipelines for build/test/deploy. Blue/green & canary deployments.

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation. Manage infra reproducibly.

Deployment targets: cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), serverless (Lambda/Cloud Functions), edge (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel).

Secrets & config: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment-based config strategies.

Observability in prod: logs aggregation, dashboards, alerting (Prometheus+Alertmanager or Datadog).

Cost & runtime optimization: right-sizing instances, caching, CDN use.

7) Security (must-have knowledge)
OWASP Top 10: injection, broken auth, XSS, CSRF, insecure deserialization, etc.

Secure coding: input validation, least privilege, proper error handling (no leaks).

Transport & secrets: HTTPS, HSTS, secure cookies, CORS best practices, token rotation.

Dependency security: SCA tools (snyk, dependabot), lockfile hygiene, CI scanning.

Threat modeling: think like an attacker — identify critical assets and mitigations.

8) Testing, reliability & QA
Testing pyramid: smaller fast unit tests → integration tests → slower E2E tests.

Automated testing: test coverage targets, CI gating.

Contract tests: ensure API changes don’t break consumers.

Chaos engineering basics: resiliency testing (time permitting in advanced roles).

Backup & recovery: DB backups, DR plans, runbooks.

9) Performance & scalability (design patterns)
Caching layers: browser cache, CDN, edge caching, server caches.

CDN strategy: asset hosting, dynamic caching rules.

Load balancing & autoscaling: stateless app design, sticky sessions caveats.

Queueing & backpressure: rate limits, retries, circuit breakers.

Database scaling: read replicas, sharding patterns, partitioning, connection pooling.

Profiling & bottleneck identification: flame graphs, CPU/memory profiling, RUM.

10) Advanced topics & trends
Serverless & edge compute for low-latency regional responses.

Microservices & service mesh (Istio/Linkerd).

WebAssembly (WASM) — heavy compute at client or portable modules.

Realtime: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, WebRTC.

Machine learning inference at edge (TensorFlow.js, ONNX).

Privacy-preserving techniques: differential privacy, federated learning (if ML adjacent).

Emerging platform APIs: WebGPU, WebAuthn.

11) Soft skills & career progression
Communication: explain tradeoffs to product & non-technical stakeholders.

Architecture & design docs: write clear RFCs and design proposals.

Mentorship & code reviews: make reviews teachable, not just gatekeeping.

Measuring impact: define success metrics and instrument features.

Leadership paths: IC progression (Senior → Staff → Principal) vs management track.

12) Real projects you should build (by stage)
Beginner

Responsive portfolio site + deploy (Netlify/Vercel).

Todo app with localStorage + basic tests.

Intermediate

Full-stack blog: Next.js + Postgres (or Headless CMS), authentication, markdown editor, image uploads, SSR/SSG.

E-commerce cart: product pages, checkout flow (mock payments), cart persistence, test suite.

Advanced

Social feed with real-time updates (WebSocket/GraphQL subscriptions), scalable APIs, moderation tools.

Multi-service system: microservices (user, product, payments), event-driven architecture, CI/CD, monitoring dashboards.

MDN Web Docs (HTML/CSS/JS) — canonical.

“You Don’t Know JS” (book series) — deep JS.

Frontend Masters / Egghead / Wes Bos courses — practical.

Free resources: freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project.

Books

18) 30/60/90 plan for getting hired as a web dev
First 30 days: learn team stack, get dev environment working, fix small bugs, add tests.
60 days: own a feature, improve CI or docs, reduce a small performance bug.
90 days: propose and implement a non-trivial improvement (feature refactor, performance gain, process/observability). Demonstrate ownership.

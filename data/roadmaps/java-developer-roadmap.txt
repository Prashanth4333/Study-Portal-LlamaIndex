A Java developer builds maintainable, performant, and secure server-side and client-side (desktop/Android/back-end) applications. Java is used across enterprise systems, cloud services, microservices, mobile (Android), big data, and embedded systems. The roadmap below focuses on becoming a professional backend/full-stack Java developer plus advanced platform expertise (JVM & performance).

High-level road map (one-line)
Beginner: Master Java syntax, OOP, basics of the JDK, and simple apps.
Intermediate: Build web services, databases, testing, containers, and CI.
Advanced: Master JVM internals, performance, distributed systems, observability, and system architecture.

Beginner (0–3 months) — fundamentals & velocity
Goal: become fluent in Java syntax, OOP, the JDK standard library, build small apps, and use an IDE.

Core skills
Java language basics: types, operators, control flow, arrays.

OOP fundamentals: classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, encapsulation.

Collections API: List, Set, Map, iterators, Comparator, Collections utilities.

Exception handling: checked vs unchecked, try-with-resources.

Basic I/O: java.nio.file.Path, Files, streams, text vs binary IO.

Basic concurrency: Thread, Runnable, synchronized, volatile (concept overview).

Use the JDK: javac, java, javadoc, jar.

Build tools intro: Maven or Gradle basics (create simple pom.xml or build.gradle).

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Community), or Eclipse/VS Code — learn debugging, breakpoints, and refactorings.

Version control: Git basics (clone, branch, commit, push, basic PR flow).

Practical tasks & small projects
Hello world + small console utilities (CSV processor, text analyzer).

Build a CLI TODO app that persists to a JSON file or SQLite (using JDBC).

Solve algorithmic puzzles (arrays, strings) to strengthen problem solving.

Commands & snippets
Compile and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac Hello.java
java Hello
Maven quick run (after mvn archetype:generate or a simple project):

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean package
java -jar target/myapp.jar
Beginner “done” checklist
Can write and debug Java programs in an IDE.

Understand and use collections and streams-of-control.

Know how to create a simple Maven/Gradle build and run tests with JUnit.

Intermediate (3–12 months) — real apps & professional craft
Goal: build web APIs, data access, automated tests, dockerized apps, CI pipelines, and write production-ready code.

Core skills
Modern Java features: lambdas, streams, Optional, var (local inference), records, text blocks (depending on your JDK version). (Learn ES-style features introduced since Java 8.)

Deep collections usage and functional operations with Stream.

Web frameworks: Spring Boot (most common), and familiarity with Jakarta EE / Micronaut / Quarkus as alternatives.

Reactive & non-blocking programming: Reactor / Project Reactor, RxJava, WebFlux, and reactive drivers (R2DBC, reactive Mongo).

Project Loom & virtual threads (if available on your JDK): model differences, when to use virtual threads vs event loops.

Architecture & distributed systems
Microservices patterns: service discovery, API gateway, circuit breaker (resilience4j), bulkhead, rate limiting, health checks.

Observability: structured logging, correlation IDs, tracing (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger), metrics (Micrometer → Prometheus + Grafana).

Message-driven systems: Kafka, RabbitMQ — exactly-once vs at-least-once semantics, partitioning strategy, consumer groups, offsets.

SLO/SLI/SLA: define availability and latency objectives.

Incident response: runbooks, blameless postmortems, observability runbooks.

Low-level optimization & native images
Profiling-guided optimization, hotspots elimination, JVM flags tuning.

GraalVM native-image: AOT builds for faster startup and smaller memory footprints (tradeoffs: reflection/config complexity).

Advanced projects (real-world complexity)
Event-driven order processing system: microservices, Kafka streams, idempotency guarantees, transactional outbox, metrics, and tracing; deploy on k8s.

High-throughput API: stress test, profile, optimize GC and thread pools, introduce circuit breakers and backpressure, monitor performance under load.

Java Concurrency in Practice — concurrency fundamentals and pitfalls.

Clean Code — engineering craft for maintainable code.

Official Oracle/OpenJDK docs and JEP pages for language/runtime changes.

Community sites: Baeldung, InfoQ, DZone, and the Spring documentation.

Career growth & practical advice (from a senior perspective)
Build and maintain a portfolio of deployed projects (GitHub + live demo).

Write small design docs and postmortems to show your thought process.

Contribute to open-source or internal libraries — shows practical impact.

Mentor juniors and participate in architecture discussions; soft skills scale your influence.

Keep learning: JVM internals, cloud-native ops, and distributed systems are long-term differentiators.

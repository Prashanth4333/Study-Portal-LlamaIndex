What is Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is the field of designing algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions, decisions, or represent data structure. ML sits at the intersection of statistics, optimization, and computer science, and it includes supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning.

1. High-level taxonomy
Supervised learning — learn mapping x → y from labeled examples. Tasks: regression (continuous y), classification (discrete y).

Unsupervised learning — find structure in unlabeled data: clustering, density estimation, dimensionality reduction.

Semi-supervised learning — small labeled + large unlabeled data.

Self-supervised learning — create labels from data itself (e.g., masked tokens) to pretrain models.

Reinforcement learning (RL) — agents learn via interaction with an environment, optimizing cumulative reward.

Probabilistic / Bayesian ML — models uncertainty explicitly, posterior inference.

Causal inference — estimating cause/effect, different from correlation-based ML.

2. ML project lifecycle / pipeline (practical)
Problem definition — business objective, metrics, constraints.

Data collection — sources, sampling, instrumentation, logging.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — distributions, missing values, correlations, value ranges, data quality.

Data preprocessing — cleaning, imputing, encoding, scaling, deduplication.

Feature engineering — domain features, interactions, aggregations, embeddings.

Model selection & training — baseline models → more complex ones.

Validation & evaluation — cross-validation, holdout, testing on future/time split for time series.

Hyperparameter tuning — grid/random/Bayesian search, early stopping.

Model interpretation & fairness checks — feature importance, bias tests.

Deployment — package model + inference API, latency/throughput SLAs.

Monitoring & maintenance — data & concept drift detection, metrics, retraining cadence.

Governance & reproducibility — version data/model/code, lineage, audits.

3. Core ML concepts & math (concise formulas)
Loss functions
MSE (regression):
MSE = (1/n) * Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2

MAE (regression):
MAE = (1/n) * Σ |y_i - ŷ_i|

Binary Cross-Entropy / Logistic loss:
L = - (1/n) * Σ [ y_i * log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) * log(1 - p_i) ]

Categorical Cross-Entropy (softmax):
L = - (1/n) * Σ Σ y_{i,c} log( p_{i,c} )

Hinge loss (SVM):
L = Σ max(0, 1 - y_i * (w·x_i + b))

Regularization
L2 (Ridge) adds λ * ||w||_2^2 to loss.

L1 (Lasso) adds λ * ||w||_1 — promotes sparsity.

Gradient descent (batch)
Update: w ← w - η * ∇_w L(w)

SGD uses mini-batches. Optimizers: SGD, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam (adaptive learning rates).

Linear regression closed form
Normal equation: w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y (works if invertible, small datasets).

4. Supervised learning algorithms (how & when)
4.1 Linear models
Linear Regression — interpretable, baseline for regression. Fast, sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.

Logistic Regression — classification using logit link and cross-entropy. Regularizable and explainable.

When to use: quick baseline, when relationships are approximately linear or for interpretability.

4.2 K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Non-parametric, lazy learner: predict by majority/vote or average over k nearest points (distance metric important). Scales poorly with large data/many features.

4.3 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Maximize margin; kernel trick enables nonlinear boundaries. Good for medium-sized datasets and text (with proper kernels).

4.4 Decision Trees
Tree splits on features; intuitive, interpretable, but overfits easily. Prune or set constraints (max_depth, min_samples_leaf).

4.5 Ensemble methods
Bagging (Random Forests) — average many trees trained on bootstrap samples; reduces variance.

Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) — sequentially combine weak learners to reduce bias/variance; excellent tabular performance.

Stacking — combine diverse models via meta-learner.

When to use: tabular data — boosted trees are often state-of-the-art. RandomForest for robustness.

5. Unsupervised learning
5.1 Clustering
K-means — partition into K clusters minimizing within-cluster variance. Sensitive to initialization; use kmeans++ initialisation.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) — soft clustering with probabilistic membership.

DBSCAN — density-based; finds arbitrarily shaped clusters and outliers.

Hierarchical clustering — agglomerative/divisive; good for dendrograms and small datasets.

5.2 Dimensionality reduction
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) — linear orthogonal projection maximizing variance. Useful for noise reduction and visualization.

t-SNE / UMAP — nonlinear embeddings for visualization (local structure preserved).

Autoencoders — NN-based compression; can be used for denoising or representation learning.

5.3 Density estimation & anomaly detection
One-class SVM, Isolation Forest, statistical models, KDE.

6. Deep Learning — foundations
Perceptron → MLP
Perceptron: linear classifier with step function.

Multi-layer perceptron (MLP): fully connected layers, nonlinearity (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid).

Activation functions
sigmoid(x), tanh(x), ReLU(x) = max(0,x), LeakyReLU, ELU, GELU. ReLU/GELU are common for deep nets.

Backpropagation
Use chain rule to compute gradients efficiently layer by layer. Automatic differentiation (autograd) frameworks handle this.

BatchNorm, LayerNorm
Normalize activations to stabilize training, allow higher learning rates.

Dropout
Randomly drop units during training to prevent co-adaptation (regularization).

7. Modern architectures (high level)
7.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Local receptive fields, weight sharing via convolution kernels. Used for images, audio, some sequences. Key concepts: strides, padding, pooling, transposed convs.

Important models: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet (skip connections), EfficientNet.

7.2 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & variants
RNNs for sequences; suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. LSTM & GRU solve long-term dependence problems.

7.3 Attention & Transformers
Self-attention computes pairwise token interactions: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k)) V.

Transformers replaced recurrence with attention, enabling parallelism and scalability. Key models: Transformer (Vaswani), BERT (bidirectional encoder), GPT (decoder-only autoregressive), T5 (encoder-decoder).

7.4 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
For graph-structured data: message passing, GraphSAGE, GAT, GCN.

8. Generative models
Autoencoders (AE) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) — encode to latent space and decode; VAE learns probabilistic latent distributions.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) — generator vs discriminator min/max game. Issues: instability, mode collapse.

Diffusion models — noise addition + learned denoising; strong recent results in image generation (and audio/text generation pipelines built on it).

Language models — autoregressive models (GPT family) and encoder models (BERT for masked modeling).

9. Reinforcement Learning (brief)
MDP (Markov Decision Process): states S, actions A, transition P, reward R, discount γ.

Value-based: Q-learning, DQN (deep Q networks).

Policy-based: REINFORCE, PPO, A2C/A3C.

Actor-Critic: actor (policy) + critic (value function).

Challenges: sample efficiency, exploration vs exploitation, reward shaping, stability.

10. Evaluation metrics & model diagnostics
Classification
Confusion matrix: TP, TN, FP, FN

Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

Precision = TP/(TP+FP)

Recall (Sensitivity) = TP/(TP+FN)

F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

ROC curve — TPR vs FPR; AUC = area under ROC

Precision-Recall curve — more informative for imbalanced classes

Regression
MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² (coefficient of determination)

Clustering
Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin, Adjusted Rand Index (if ground truth exists)

Model calibration
Check if predicted probabilities correspond to true likelihoods (reliability diagrams, calibration loss).

11. Model selection, validation & hyperparameter tuning
Cross-validation
k-fold CV (stratified for class imbalance).

Time series CV (no shuffling — use expanding window / rolling window).

Nested CV for unbiased hyperparameter tuning estimate.

Search methods
Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna, Hyperopt), Hyperband, Population-based training (PBT).

Early stopping
Monitor validation metric; stop training when performance plateaus to avoid overfitting.

12. Feature engineering & data preprocessing
Common transforms
Scaling: StandardScaler (zero mean unit var), MinMaxScaler (0–1), RobustScaler.

Encoding categorical: One-hot, ordinal, target/mean encoding, embeddings.

Imputation: mean/median/mode, KNN imputation, model-based imputation.

Feature interaction: polynomial features, cross features.

Datetime features: day-of-week, hour, cyclical transforms (sin/cos).

Text: tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, TF-IDF, word embeddings (word2vec/GloVe), contextual embeddings (BERT).

Images: normalization, resizing, augmentation (flip, crop, color jitter).

Feature selection
Filter methods: correlation, mutual information.

Wrapper methods: recursive feature elimination (RFE).

Embedded: feature importance from tree models, L1 regularization.

13. Regularization & generalization
L1/L2 penalties.

Dropout, data augmentation, early stopping, ensembling.

Label smoothing (in classification) to improve generalization.

Batch size & learning rate trade-offs: larger batches can require learning-rate scaling.

14. Interpretability & explainability
Global vs local interpretability.

Tools & methods:

Permutation importance (model-agnostic).

Feature importance (tree models).

SHAP (Shapley values) — theoretically grounded local explanations.

LIME — local linear surrogate models.

Partial dependence plots (PDP) and ICE plots.

Be careful: explanations are approximations; they can be misleading if used blindly.

15. Production & MLOps (operationalizing models)
Model packaging: pickle/ONNX/TensorFlow SavedModel/TorchScript. Avoid untrusted pickle usage.

Serving:

Lightweight: Flask/FastAPI + uvicorn/gunicorn (synchronous or async).

Dedicated servers: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Triton Inference Server.

Serverless: AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions — good for low-traffic or event-driven functions.

Scaling: containerize (Docker), orchestrate (Kubernetes), autoscaling, GPU nodes for heavy inference.

Monitoring: input data drift, model performance (prediction distribution, accuracy on known checks), latency/throughput, resource usage. Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, Evidently, WhyLabs.

CI/CD for models: automated testing for model code, data validation, model regression tests, canary rollouts / shadow testing.

Model registry & lineage: MLflow, Kubeflow, Sagemaker Model Registry.

16. Reproducibility & governance
Version control for code (git) and datasets (DVC, Quilt, Delta Lake).

Seed management for deterministic training where possible.

Environment management: conda/npm/pip + container images.

Documentation: model cards, datasheets for datasets (proposed by Gebru et al.) — capture intended use, limitations, fairness considerations.

17. Bias, fairness, privacy & ethics
Fairness definitions: group fairness, individual fairness, equalized odds, demographic parity — tradeoffs exist.

Privacy: de-identification is not foolproof. Techniques: differential privacy, federated learning, encrypted inference (homomorphic encryption, secure MPC).

Adversarial robustness: adversarial examples (small perturbations can fool models). Consider robustness testing.

Ethical considerations: misuse potential, feedback loops, transparency, human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions.

18. Scaling & distributed training
Data parallelism — replicate model on multiple GPUs/nodes, split mini-batches, synchronize gradients (AllReduce).

Model parallelism — partition model across devices (useful for very large models).

Mixed precision (FP16) — faster training + memory saving using AMP (automatic mixed precision).

Frameworks: PyTorch Distributed, Horovod, DeepSpeed, FairScale, TensorFlow MirroredStrategy.

19. Hardware & performance tips
Use GPUs (NVIDIA) or TPUs for deep learning. For CPUs, use optimized BLAS (MKL, OpenBLAS).

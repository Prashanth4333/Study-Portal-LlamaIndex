What is Java — quick definition
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and a platform (specification + tools + runtime) designed for portability and reliability: “Write Once, Run Anywhere” — Java source → bytecode → JVM executes bytecode on any OS with a compatible JVM. The platform consists of the language, the JDK (development kit), the JRE (runtime), and the JVM (virtual machine).

Short history & release model (important)
Java was created at Sun Microsystems (led by James Gosling) in the early 1990s (project names: Green → Oak → Java) and publicly released in 1995. It quickly grew into a dominant platform for enterprise, web, mobile (Android uses Java-like bytecode), and embedded systems.

Baeldung on Kotlin

Since Java 9, the JDK moved to a time-based release cadence: a new feature release every 6 months and a Long-Term-Support (LTS) release roughly every 2 years (LTS examples: Java 8, 11, 17, 21). This steady cadence lets new features arrive faster while LTS releases provide stability for production.

The Java platform (editions & components)
Java SE (Standard Edition): core language + libraries (collections, concurrency, IO, NIO, security, JDBC, etc.).

Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE): enterprise APIs/specs (servlets, JPA/Hibernate, JAX-RS, JMS). Enterprise Java was moved to the Eclipse Foundation and rebranded as Jakarta EE. 
jakarta.ee

Java ME: for constrained devices/embedded.

JDK vs JRE vs JVM:

JDK = Java Development Kit (javac, tools, libraries).

JRE = Java Runtime Environment (JVM + runtime libs).

JVM = executes bytecode; provides memory management, class loading, JIT compilation.

Language evolution — major language features (timeline & why they matter)
Java evolved steadily to reduce verbosity, improve concurrency, and add modern language constructs:

Java 5: generics, enhanced for-each, annotations, enum.

Java 7: try-with-resources, Strings in switch (limited), NIO.2 (filesystem).

Java 8: lambda expressions, Streams API, java.time (new date/time), major functional-style additions. (This was the biggest productivity jump for many.)

Java 9: module system (JPMS) — modular JDK and module descriptors (module-info.java). (Project Jigsaw / JEP 261.) 
openjdk.org

Java 10+: var for local-type inference, many small improvements.

Java 14–21: records, pattern matching, sealed classes, text blocks, switch expressions, virtual threads (Project Loom — finalized as JEP 444 in JDK 21), structured concurrency (preview/incubator stages), and more. Virtual threads are a major change for concurrent programming (lightweight threads managed by the JVM).

Code playground — short, useful examples
Hello world, OOP, lambda/streams, generics, simple concurrency:

Hello world

java
Copy
Edit
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
Class + record (Java 16+)

java
Copy
Edit
public class Person {
    private final String name;
    public Person(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
}

// record (shorter)
public record PersonRec(String name) {}
Lambda + Streams (Java 8+)

java
Copy
Edit
List<String> names = List.of("Riva","Alex","Sam");
List<String> sorted = names.stream()
                           .filter(s -> s.length() > 3)
                           .map(String::toUpperCase)
                           .sorted()
                           .toList();
Threads (classic)

java
Copy
Edit
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("hi"));
t.start();
ExecutorService + CompletableFuture

java
Copy
Edit
ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchData(), es)
                 .thenApply(this::process)
                 .thenAccept(System.out::println);
Virtual threads (JDK 21+)

java
Copy
Edit
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> { /* lightweight concurrent task */ });
}
(virtual threads let you create very many concurrent tasks cheaply).

JVM internals (high level)
The JVM is where most of the “magic” happens:

Class loader subsystem: loads bytecode .class files into the JVM; supports hierarchical classloaders (bootstrap, platform, application), enabling dynamic loading and modularity.

Bytecode & Class file: Java source → javac → .class bytecode (platform independent). The JVM specification defines the class file format and bytecode semantics. 
Oracle Documentation

Memory areas: heap (objects; young & old generations), stack (per-thread frames/local vars), method area (class metadata — metaspace in modern JVMs), native memory for JVM internals.

Execution engine: interpreter + JIT compilers (HotSpot’s C1/C2 historically, and Graal as an alternative JIT/compile option). JIT compiles hot methods to native code for speed.

GC (Garbage Collector): multiple algorithms (see next section). The JVM provides many tunable flags (e.g., -Xms, -Xmx, -XX:+UseG1GC, -XX:+UseZGC). 
GeeksforGeeks

Garbage collectors (GC) — practical overview & modern choices
GC is huge; here are the common HotSpot collectors and what they’re used for:

G1 (Garbage-First) — default in modern Java (made default around Java 9). Good balance of throughput and pause-time control for large heaps. Use when you want predictable pauses and good throughput. 
openjdk.org
Oracle Documentation

Parallel / ParallelOld (Throughput collector) — focuses on throughput; longer pauses acceptable.

ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) — low-latency GC designed to keep pause times tiny (under a few ms) even with very large heaps. Good for latency-sensitive services. Introduced experimentally and matured in later JDKs (JEP 333). 
openjdk.org
Oracle Documentation

Shenandoah — another low-pause GC (from Red Hat / OpenJDK).

CMS (concurrent mark-sweep) — older; largely superseded by G1/ZGC.

GC tuning basics: choose appropriate collector, set heap sizes (-Xms -Xmx), use -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis for G1, profile with JFR/VisualVM/async-profiler to find allocation hotspots, tune survivor spaces and tenuring if needed.

Performance & observability tools
Java Flight Recorder (JFR) and Java Mission Control (JMC) — low-overhead event recording built into the JDK (excellent for production profiling). 
Oracle Documentation

VisualVM — GUI profiler + heap/CPU analysis. 
visualvm.github.io

async-profiler, YourKit, JProfiler — powerful profilers for CPU/allocations/lock contention.

Use jcmd, jmap, jstack, jstat for diagnostics on running JVMs.

Ecosystem: frameworks, languages, build & test tools
Frameworks:

Spring (Spring Boot) — the dominant enterprise framework for building web apps, microservices, dependency injection, data access. (Spring Boot accelerates production apps.) 
Home

Jakarta EE (enterprise specs), Quarkus, Micronaut, Vert.x, Play — modern choices focused on microservices, cloud-native, or reactive performance (Quarkus & Micronaut emphasize fast startup + Graal native image support). 
quarkus.io
Micronaut Framework

Build tools: Maven (pom.xml) and Gradle (Groovy/Kotlin DSL) — most projects use one of these. 
maven.apache.org
Gradle

Testing: JUnit (5), Mockito, AssertJ, Testcontainers for integration tests. 
docs.junit.org
site.mockito.org

IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA (most Java devs), Eclipse, NetBeans, and VS Code (with Java extensions).

Native images & GraalVM
If you need very fast startup and low memory for serverless/microservices, GraalVM Native Image compiles ahead-of-time to a native binary (AOT). This removes the JVM JIT warmup cost and reduces runtime memory but requires dealing with reflection/config metadata and has different tradeoffs. Many frameworks (Quarkus, Micronaut) provide Graal-friendly modes. 
graalvm.org
guides.micronaut.io

Modern concurrency (Project Loom) — why it matters
Classic Java concurrency used OS threads (heavy for many-blocking I/O tasks). Virtual threads (Project Loom → JEP 444) introduce extremely lightweight threads managed by the JVM so you can use simple blocking style code at huge scale (e.g., millions of virtual threads) without complex asynchronous callback code. JDK 21 finalized virtual threads as a production-ready feature. This simplifies code and improves scalability for IO-bound apps. 
openjdk.org
Oracle

Modules (JPMS) — packing and strong encapsulation
The Java Platform Module System (JPMS, JEP 261) introduced modules (module-info.java) to provide strong encapsulation and avoid “classpath hell”. Modules help large apps and make smaller runtime images possible (useful for native images and smaller container images). Adoption across the ecosystem was gradual because many libraries had to adapt. 
openjdk.org

Best practices (practical)
Use an LTS JDK for production (e.g., Java 17 or 21) unless you need a feature in non-LTS. 
Oracle

Prefer immutability and small, focused classes; use records for value carriers.

Use modern concurrency primitives: Executors, CompletableFuture, and (on JDK 21+) virtual threads where suitable. 
openjdk.org

Profile, don’t guess: use JFR + async-profiler to find hotspots before tuning GC. 
Oracle Documentation

For microservices: favor frameworks tailored for cloud (Quarkus, Micronaut, Spring Boot), containerize, and use health checks/metrics/tracing (Micrometer/OpenTelemetry).
